  		  			<P>
  		  			 I'm a girl aged 19 who is willing to help orphans and my aim is just not about "helping them"but also to help them build theirself esteem and show them guidence,give them love that they were seeking for.My aim of doing this is because i have encountered several things that orphans are facing out  there,like being un:loved,educated,no house  to  be in there e.t.c.This things have touched my heart so badly,seing a child livng in a street without no parent,no clothes,no food to eat is so hurting.

  				<h2>ABOUT MABALEHA ITUMELENG</h2>
  					<P>
  						I am a girl who is going to write her final examinaton of the last class"FORME".I am very concerned about orphans and i think its time for us to fight for their live and future because they too deserve better but most is to have someone who cares and guide them.We all know that a child to say that is a child he/she has to be corrected and told what is wrong and what is right.Never forget that helping one another is very important.Lets help one another.

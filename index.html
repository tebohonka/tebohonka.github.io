                  No parent chooses to leave his/her children alone without no one helping them or just abonden them just like that.Every child deserves to have all the needs that are provided by parents like:love,food,security,e.t.c,so if there is no parents to guide the child,it is so horrible and the life for the child is going to be hard.

       				<p>
    					No parent chooses to leave his/her children alone as orphans and no child chooses to have no parent.
        			</p>

    				<p>
    					Its very hurting to see children suffering out there,having no one to help them.People consider them as non-livng things whereas they are not,they deserve better like anyone on this world.Criticizing them,descriminating wont change their status but it will put them into a DEEP DEPRESSION.
    				</p>
    				<p>
    					It is better to support,bringing them closer to other people and show them love.Remember that helping each other is important.
              SUMMERHILL HOUSE is a non-profit organization (registered)whose sole and motivation is to provide homes and personal transformation for orphans that have been affected.At SUMMERWILL HOUSE we want to give orphans what the have lost like:LOVE,AN EDUCATION,BED TO SLEEP and FOOD.

     					<p>
							 Education status is an important indicator of children wellbering and future life oppotunities.It can predict growth potential and economic viablity of a state.While this is ideal situaton for all children,the case may be different for orphans and vulnerable children due to the challenges they go through on a daily bases.

                  <h6>BUILDING HOUSES FOR THE ORPHANS</h6>
                  <p>  
                    Throughout our world, hundreds upon thousands of children are kept in orphanages. These children, who have no home, no parents, and no siblings to play with, are kept in a place where all they have left is their childhood; and even that is taken away from them in these living hells. Most people would define the word orphanage as a public or private institution for the care and protection of children without parents.Children placed in orphan homes are loved and nurtured by a married couple who serve as house parents. Placement at an orphan home allows children to avoid the overcrowded environments of large orphanages where it is difficult for children to receive the nurture and care needed to ensure a healthy well-being.
